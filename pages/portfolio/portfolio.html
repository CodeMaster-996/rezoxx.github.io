                <p>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
                and the only way to be truly satisfied 
                is to do what you believe is great work.
                And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
                If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. 
                Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, 
                you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, 
                it just gets better and better as the years roll on."

                                I completed my high school in 2022 with average marks. 
                                Since the beginning of high school, 
                                I developed an interest in programming, designing, and developing. 
                                It was the starting point of my career.
